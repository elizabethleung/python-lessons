# Lesson 2: OOP and Version Control HW

### Task 1 - Set up:
Download and install Git on any machine you plan to use. Clone the repo we created during 
our lesson.

### Task 2 - Read:
Review the lesson slides and read the lesson review document for the last class.

### Task 3 - Design:
Design an object that exhibits encapsulation. It must have at least 2 fields and 4 methods.
You can follow the Truck example we went over in the lesson.

_Bonus_: Have 1 of the methods take an argument.

Name your text file as **oop-\<name of object>** (eg. oop-truck.txt) and save it in a **lesson2** directory.

Commit and push your changes. 

Create a pull request to master.

Merge the pull request.

Comment on the Trello card once you are complete.
